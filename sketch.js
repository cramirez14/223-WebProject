/* Carlos Ramirez, Web Project
I used the p5play tool to create this program. I learned a lot about the tool like its colliders and all the different types there are.
I learned about their sprite function which allows for the creation of sprites and how to customize these sprites to my liking. 
I learned how to create groups which can store multiple sprites that are similar to each other like an array. In my program I applied 
many topics such as classes, constructors, methods, global variables, functions, loops and much more. */
